# Reflection

This mod adds a short conversation with Imoen following the appearance of Gorion's Wraith (in TOB). Because, hey, it should affect her too! Although the Imoen Romance mod includes a similar conversation, I wanted to write my own spin on it. Please note there will be some content incompatibility between the two mods as a result.

Honestly, for more in-depth Imoen goodness, please install Imoen4Ever and Imoen Friendship. Since those are fully fledged expansions on her character. Reflection exists only to fill a gap that neither of those mods cover at the moment.


FAQ

Q: Why is Imoen so wildly OOC?
A: With canon characters, especially ones as beloved as Imoen, players will have different interpretations. I don't think she's OOC but your opinion may differ. I also don't claim to be good at mimicking her exact manner of speech. 

Q: I have ideas for dialogue tweaks, fixes or additions.
A: Please send them my way. I'd love to include as many options as possible, but I can't cover every possibility by myself. The class-specific dialogue, especially in later parts, remains rough and unpolished. It will be refined, or even completely rewritten, in future updates. :)

Q: Any plans for TRA-ifying?
A: Given its current, minimal content, I doubt anyone plans to translate this mod. With the full mod release, yes, the dialogue will be TRA-ified. 

Q: Why release then?
A: I'm a big fan of the BGCCCC initiative and wanted to contribute. Even in a small way. Thanks to Glittergear for letting me do just that. <3

Q: This conversation feels incredibly short.
A: When you're reading a single thread, of a single class, it certainly will. However writing for multiple classes takes a lot of work! All kidding aside, this is intended as a much larger mod with new questlines. Sarevok and Imoen's talks will be a single component of that. 

Q: The flesh is weak!
A: Even in death I serve the Omnissiah! :3
